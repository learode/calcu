# Bugs
1. When the results is issued and a digit is entered, the question scrn doesnot clear but appends the digit to the end. If the equal sign is then click the prev operator is used with the firstOperate.
remove this such that if the result is issued and a digit is click, the question screen, the operator, the value of the firstOperand are cleared.

2. if the equal sign is click twice or so, it results to NaN: disable equal when it is first click and enable when updateDom is called.
3. Don't accept any sign from the operators side unless a value is present
4. Disable multiple dots
